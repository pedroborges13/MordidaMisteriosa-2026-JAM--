# 2 Reais ou uma Mordida Misteriosa? (2026-Game Jam) 
Developed for the CRTL ALT Jam. Theme: "Everything should, but not everything can" (Tudo deve, mas nem tudo pode)

This game was developed in jus 4-5 days of active work during a 9-day Game Jam, due to team schedule conflicts. It is a suspense simulation where you receive a gift box. However, the content inside might be a friendly pet or a dangerous predator.
The core gameplay resolves around resource management and observation. You must use your limited Action Points to interact with the box and gather clues before making a final guess. But be careful: every interaction increases the animal's Stress Level. If it gets too high, the animal might flee or attack!
